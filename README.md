# AzureADPasswordReset.gbapp
Custom dialogs for reseting user password in Azure Active Directory, Office 365, Dynamics 365 or any app published through Azure AD.

**DISCLAIMER**: **This is an experimental package - Use it at you own risk**

According to Dan Kershaw, the only way to reset an user's password programaticaly is to use changePassword within user context that has the Directory.AccessAsUser.All permission.

>Change Password - in Microsoft Graph (although not documented) you'll find the "changePassword" method on user - ../users/{id}/changePassword, which takes the old password and a new password. This API works ONLY for the signed-in user (so it requires the delegated OAuth2 code flow). It requires an admin to consent for Directory.AccessAsUser.All (although we are looking at adding a more granular permission).

## Bot Administrator - Generate Token

So the Bot provides an **admin** mode allowing the user having the Directory.AccessAsUser.All permission to be logged on Administrative interface to obtain and save its token into the database.

## Bot User - Reset Password

With the access token stored in the database, any user can access anonymously  the 
bot and through a combination of e-mail and password will be able to reset her or his password.
